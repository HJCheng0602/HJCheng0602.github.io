Here, I build my first [website](https://hjcheng0602.github.io/)(not the first but the first one I'm serious about building/running)ðŸ˜‹.

My website will include:

## study course expriences

This kind of content will record my experiences learning some meaningful courses in PKU.I hope it will help me review my courses.

## research experiences

As a college student, researching and finding will be the main task in the future. Currently I am interested in 3R(3D reconstruction). So maybe I will update huge contents about my reflections for each paper.

## my own projects

Of course, my some great(just in my standard) project will be post on the site. It's meaningful to me as long as I think it's great, regardless of how others see it.

...

Above might be the main topics of content in the site.

### Additions

The posts will be in Chinese and English randomly(maybe most time ChineseðŸ¤£).Please forgive my poor English.
